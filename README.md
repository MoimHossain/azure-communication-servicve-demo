You would need some environment variables to make it work.

- ```ACS_ENDPOINT```: The endpoint of the Azure Communication Service. 
- ```ACS_SMS_ENDPOINT```: The endpoint of the Azure Communication Service for SMS.
- ```AZ_UAMI_CLIENTID```: The client id of User Assigned Managed Identity.

You can set them in local mahcine like below

```
export ACS_SENDER_EMAIL="DoNotReply@mail.octo-lamp.nl"
export ACS_ENDPOINT="XXX"
export ACS_SMS_ENDPOINT="XXX"
```

> When running locally, you need to change the supply the following, and remove the ```AZ_UAMI_CLIENTID``` environment variable. 

```
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=""
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=""
```


#### Compile/Recompile the package

> Sometimes ```./mvnw``` gives a bad interpreter for unix/dos incompatible line endings, in that case use ```mv.sh```

```
./mvnw clean package
```

#### Running locally
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

With Docker,
```
docker run --rm -e AZ_COMMUNICATION_SERVICE_CONN_STRING="XXX" -e AZ_COMM_SMS_CONN_STR="XXX" -p 8081:8080 moimhossain/acsemailservice:beta1
```
